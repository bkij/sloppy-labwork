  <h1>About Deck Registration</h1>
  <p>Many online tournaments ask players to prove they have access to a deck
  before using it in an event. Usually this involves taking a picture
  of your deck's archon card alongside a handwritten note.</p>

  <p>The registration service here aims to streamline that process for
  players and tournament organizers. Players get a consistent verification
  experience, and organizers get less overhead and can focus on running their
  event.</p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>Our goals for this service are pretty simple:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Streamline event sign-up for player and organizers.</li>
    <li>Make it easy to share decks with your friends, teammates, and community.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We believe <strong>sharing is good</strong> and want to put tools in the
  hands of event organizers that make sharing as frictionless as
  possible.</p>

  <h2>How It Works, For Players</h2>
  <p>Registering a deck with <span class="brand">Sloppy Labwork</span> will
  feel similar to deck verification processes you might have experienced with
  online events in the past. After creating an account, you can submit a
  registration request <a href="{% url 'register-new' %}">here</a>. Your
  registration request will include a link to your deck as well as a photo of your
  deck and a handwritten note.</p>

  <p>Before, you might have included contact information and a date in
  verification photos. Instead, we generate random verification codes for
  each request. This removes the need to have a date in your photo - we know
  the exact time each code is generated. Similarly, these codes are tied to
  the <span class="brand">Sloppy Labwork</span> account that submitted the
  deck registration request. Registration requests will be associated with
  the contact information in your account, even if you update that
  information later.</p>

  <p>When a registration request is submitted, <span class="brand">Sloppy
  Labwork</span> will attempt to parse your deck's name and a handwritten
  verification code from the photo automatically. When that happens, your
  request may be approved within seconds of the time it was submitted. If
  we're unable to verify your request automatically, it will then be reviewed
  by a <span class="brand">Sloppy Labwork</span> administrator. Once
  approved, you will be able to sign up for events using that deck.</p>

  <p>In a rush? If we aren't able to verify your first request automatically
  you may submit a new request for the same deck and we'll archive your
  previous attempt. Within a single day you may submit up to ten registration
  requests.</p>

  <p>Here are some tips for ensuring your verification photo can be processed
  automatically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your photo should show the <strong>back</strong> of any card from
    your deck. If you see a QR code (for archon cards) or can read the card's
    name, flip it over.</li>
    <li>Use a card other than the archon card. Every card in your deck has
    its name printed on the back. We prefer not to use archon cards as those
    also have house names spelled out.</li>
    <li>If your deck is still sealed, you <strong>do not</strong> need to
    unwrap it. See the example photo below.</li>
    <li>The deck name should be fully visible, in focus, and with minimal
    glare. Be mindful of glare obscuring your deck's name when it is still in
    cellophane</li>
    <li>Make sure there is no other writing or text in your image. Other text
    might confuse our automated process.</li>
    <li>Use a plain background with no markings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Here's an example that will verify automatically without issue:
  </p>

  <p class="photo-group">
    <img src="https://static.sloppylabwork.com/sample-verification-photo-01.jpg" alt="Sample verification photo" />
  </p>

  <p>Keep in mind that, after verification, your photo will be visible to
  others who would like to double check your claim. We will also display
  partially obfuscated versions of your contact info in the public registry.
  For example, we would show <code>j*******l</code> instead of
  <code>jtrussell</code>. Event organizers will have access to your
  non-obfuscated contact info once you have signed up for one of their
  events.</p>
