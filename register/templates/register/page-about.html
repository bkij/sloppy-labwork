  <h1>About Deck Registration</h1>
  <p>Many online tournaments ask players to prove they have access to a deck
  before using it in an event. Usually this involves taking a picture
  of your deck's archon card alongside a handwritten note.</p>

  <p>The registration service here aims to streamline that process for
  players and tournament organizers. Players get a consistent verification
  experience, and organizers get less overhead and can focus on running their
  event.</p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>Our goals for this service are pretty simple:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Streamline event sign-up for player and organizers.</li>
    <li>Make it easy to share decks with your friends, teammates, and community.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We believe <strong>sharing is good</strong> and want to put tools in the
  hands of event organizers that make sharing as frictionless as
  possible.</p>

  <h2>How It Works, For Players</h2>
  <p>Registering a deck with <span class="brand">Sloppy Labwork</span> will
  feel similar to deck verification processes you might have experienced with
  online events in the past. After creating an account, you can submit a
  registration request <a href="{% url 'register-new' %}">here</a>. Your
  registration request will include a link to your deck, a photo of your
  archon card, and a handwritten note containing a randomly generated 5-digit
  code specific to your registration request.</p>

  <p>Before, you might have included contact information and a date in
  verification photos. Instead, we generate random verification codes for
  each request. This removes the need to have a date in your photo - we know
  the exact time each code is generated. Similarly, these codes are tied to
  the <span class="brand">Sloppy Labwork</span> account that submitted the
  deck registration request. Registration requests will be associated with
  the contact information in your account, even if you update that
  information later.</p>

  <p>When a verification request is submitted, <span class="brand">Sloppy
  Labwork</span> will attempt to parse your deck's name and handwritten code
  from the photo automatically. When that happens, your request may be
  approved within seconds of the time it was submitted. If we're unable to
  verify your request automatically, it will then be reviewed by a
  <span class="brand">Sloppy Labwork</span> administrator. Once approved, you will
  be able to sign up for events using that deck.</p>

  <p>In a rush? If we aren't able to verify your first request automatically
  you may submit a new request for the same deck and we'll archive your
  previous attempt. Within a single day you may submit up to ten registration
  requests.</p>

  <p>Here are some tips for ensuring your verification photo can be processed
  automatically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>back</strong> of your archon card should be face up. This
    is the side with archon artwork, <strong>not</strong> a QR code. If see a
    QR code, flip the card over.</li>
    <li>The deck name should be fully visible, in focus, and with minimal
    glare. This is the only part of the card that need visible for
    verification. Be mindful of glare obscuring your deck's name, especially
    if it is still in cellophane</li>
    <li>Make sure there is no other writing or text in your image. Other text
    might confuse our automated process.</li>
    <li>If possible, use a plain background - like a sheet unmarked paper -
    for contrast. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Here's an example that will verify automatically without issue:
  </p>

  <p class="photo-group">
    <img src="https://static.sloppylabwork.com/sample-verification-photo-01.jpg" alt="Sample verification photo" />
  </p>

  <p>Keep in mind that, after verification, your photo will be visible to
  others who would like to double check your claim. We will also display
  partially obfuscated versions of your contact info in the public registry.
  For example, we would show <code>j*******l</code> instead of
  <code>jtrussell</code>. Event organizers will have access to your
  non-obfuscated contact info once you have signed up for one of their
  events.</p>
